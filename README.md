# CanvasWizard: Unleash Your Creativity with Hand Gestures

## Overview

Welcome to CanvasWizard, an innovative and interactive digital art project that turns your computer's camera into a magical canvas! With CanvasWizard, you can create beautiful artwork using nothing but your hand gestures, merging the worlds of computer vision, machine learning, and artistic expression.

CanvasWizard relies on two powerful technologies:

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library): OpenCV, an open-source software library, empowers CanvasWizard to process real-time webcam images and analyze hand movements for precise control.

Mediapipe: Developed by Google, Mediapipe serves as the framework for hand landmark detection and tracking. It allows your hand gestures to seamlessly translate into creative digital strokes.

This project is an exciting fusion of technology and artistry, offering an exploration into the future of human-computer interaction. So, let your imagination run wild, and let your hands paint your dreams with CanvasWizard!

## Key Features

Say goodbye to traditional tools! CanvasWizard leverages your webcam to track your hand movements in real-time, offering an immersive painting experience.

### ðŸŽ¨ Gesture-Based Drawing
No need for a stylus or mouse. Different hand gestures are recognized and translated into drawing actions, allowing you to create intricate patterns, shapes, and more.

### ðŸŒˆ Colorful Creations
